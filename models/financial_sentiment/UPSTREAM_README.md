# DistilRoberta-financial-sentiment


This model is a fine-tuned version of [distilroberta-base](https://huggingface.co/distilroberta-base) on the financial_phrasebank dataset.
It achieves the following results on the evaluation set:
- Loss: 0.1116
- Accuracy: **0.98**23

## Base Model description

This model is a distilled version of the [RoBERTa-base model](https://huggingface.co/roberta-base). It follows the same training procedure as [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased).
The code for the distillation process can be found [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/distillation).
This model is case-sensitive: it makes a difference between English and English.

The model has 6 layers, 768 dimension and 12 heads, totalizing 82M parameters (compared to 125M parameters for RoBERTa-base).
On average DistilRoBERTa is twice as fast as Roberta-base.

## Training Data

Polar sentiment dataset of sentences from financial news. The dataset consists of 4840 sentences from English language financial news categorised by sentiment. The dataset is divided by agreement rate of 5-8 annotators.

## Training procedure
